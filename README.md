We have a craving for food and want to explore the restaurant scene. We are aware that there is a database with all the data we need to make our choices for food. We want to use an ORM and its functions to query the database.

The first step is to determine how the mapping between the database and python is. Take a look at the models.py file. Replace all ...s with appropriate fields. Consult the Peewee documentation. Assume that all fields that are not already filled in, have no constraints.

Once the mapping between the database tables and the python models is done, you can start work on the queries. These are located in the main.py file. The expected results for all queries are defined in the function comments. All you have to do is complete the functions.

You can check your result with wincpy check.
